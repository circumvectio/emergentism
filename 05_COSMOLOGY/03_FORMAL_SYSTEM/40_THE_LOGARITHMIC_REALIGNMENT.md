## 1. The Two Symmetries of the Number Line

The positive real line `ℝ₊ = (0, ∞)` carries two natural involutions — self-inverse symmetries that exchange the two boundary regions. [A]

| Property | Additive symmetry | Multiplicative symmetry |
|---|---|---|
| **Map** | `x ↦ −x` (requires negative numbers) | `x ↦ 1/x` (stays in `ℝ₊`) |
| **Fixed point** | `0` | `1` |
| **Boundary exchange** | `+∞ ↔ −∞` | `0 ↔ ∞` |
| **Natural coordinate** | `x` itself | `s = log x` |
| **Natural metric** | `\|x − 0\| = \|x\|` | `\|log x\| = \|s\|` |
| **Identity element** | `0` (add nothing) | `1` (multiply by one) |

Under the logarithmic diffeomorphism `h : ℝ₊ → ℝ`, `h(x) = log x`:

```
h(1/x) = −log x = −h(x)
```

**The reciprocal map on ℝ₊ is the reflection map on ℝ.** They are the same involution in two different coordinate charts. [A]

## 2. The Three Charts

Three equivalent coordinate systems for the same structure. All diffeomorphic to each other. All fix the same point. [A]

### Chart 1: Multiplicative (`x ∈ ℝ₊`)

- Inversion: `x ↦ 1/x`
- Fixed point: `x = 1` (the only positive real satisfying `x = 1/x`)
- Boundaries: `x → 0⁺` (south pole) and `x → ∞` (north pole)
- Natural metric: `|log x|`

### Chart 2: Additive (`s = log x ∈ ℝ`)

- Inversion: `s ↦ −s` (simple reflection through origin)
- Fixed point: `s = 0` (corresponds to `x = 1`)
- Boundaries: `s → −∞` (south pole) and `s → +∞` (north pole)
- Natural metric: `|s|`

This is the chart where the manifold identity becomes the **zero sum**:

```
φ · ν = 1    ⟹    log φ + log ν = 0    ⟹    s_φ + s_ν = 0
```

The two log-deviations from finity cancel exactly. The name "Zero-Sum Resolution Equation" is literal in this chart.

### Chart 3: Bounded / Hinge (`u = (x−1)/(x+1) ∈ (−1, 1)`)

- Inversion: `u ↦ −u` (half-twist about center)
- Fixed point: `u = 0` (corresponds to `x = 1`)
- Boundaries: `u → −1⁺` (south pole) and `u → +1⁻` (north pole)
- Natural metric: `|u|`

The Cayley transform compresses the entire positive real line into a bounded interval with finity at the center. This is the "Egg of Infinity" — both poles sit on the rim, unity at the center.

### Chart equivalence [A]

```
x = eˢ = (1+u)/(1−u)
s = log x = 2 arctanh(u)
u = tanh(s/2) = (x−1)/(x+1)
```

All three fix the same point (`x=1, s=0, u=0`). All three exchange the same poles. All three carry the same involution as `· ↦ − ·`.

## 3. Every Framework Object in Log Coordinates

### 3.1 The Canonical Formula Block

| Verbatim block | Log form (`s = log ν`) | Name in log chart |
|---|---|---|
| `φ · ν = 1 on S²` | `s_φ + s_ν = 0` | **Zero sum** (literal) |
| `(φ − ν)² ≥ 0` | `(eˢ − e⁻ˢ)² ≥ 0` | Squared deviation |
| `φ + ν ≥ 2` | `eˢ + e⁻ˢ ≥ 2`, i.e. `2 cosh(s) ≥ 2` | **cosh bound** (=2 iff s=0) |

The inequality `φ + ν ≥ 2` becomes `cosh(s) ≥ 1` — the elementary fact that the hyperbolic cosine is minimized at the origin. [A]

### 3.2 Balance, Energy, Hamiltonian

| Object | Sphere form | Log form | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Balance** `B` | `B = sin θ` | `B = sech(s) = 1/cosh(s)` | Max `1` at `s=0`, → `0` at `s→±∞` |
| **Energy** `E` | `E = (log tan(θ/2))²` | `E = s²` | Min `0` at `s=0`, → `+∞` at poles |
| **Hamiltonian** `H` | `H = 2/sin θ` | `H = 2 cosh(s)` | Min `2` at `s=0` |
| **Alignment energy** | `E = −log B` | `E = log cosh(s)` | Min `0` at `s=0` |

The **exact bijection** between B and E: [A]

```
B = sech(√E)          E = (arcsech B)²
```

Near the equator: `E ≈ 2(1 − B)` — Suda's energy is twice the balance deficit to leading order.

### 3.3 The Titan Emblem

```
⊙ = • × ○     →     log ⊙ = log • + log ○     →     0 = (−∞) + (+∞)
```

In log coordinates, the emblematic equation becomes a statement about pole symmetry: the two infinities of the logarithmic line are exactly balanced around the origin. The void is at `s = −∞`, the unbounded at `s = +∞`, and finity sits at `s = 0` — equidistant from both.

### 3.4 The Extraction Coefficient η

In log coordinates, η measures asymmetry of the log-deviation:

```
η ~ |s_extraction| / |s_contribution|
```

- η < 1: the system's log-extraction is less than its log-contribution → net movement toward equator
- η = 1: extraction equals contribution → trophic balance
- η > 1: extraction exceeds contribution → net movement away from equator
- η → ∞: pure extraction, zero contribution → ground negation

This reframes the moral axis as the **sign of the log-deviation's time derivative**: are you moving toward `s = 0` or away from it?

## 4. What the Logarithmic Realignment Reveals

### 4.1 The Zero Sum Is Literal

The framework's name has always been "Zero-Sum Resolution Equation." In log coordinates, this is not metaphorical. The manifold identity becomes `s_φ + s_ν = 0` — a literal zero sum. The two log-deviations from finity cancel exactly.

### 4.2 All Operations Simplify

On the multiplicative (ordinary) line, the framework's operations are multiplicative:
- Identity: `φ · ν = 1` (product of reciprocals)
- Hamiltonian: `H = φ + 1/φ` (sum of a number and its reciprocal)
- Balance: `B = sin θ` (trigonometric)

On the logarithmic line, all of these become elementary:
- Identity: `s + (−s) = 0` (sum of signed numbers)
- Hamiltonian: `H = 2 cosh(s)` (hyperbolic cosine)
- Balance: `B = sech(s)` (hyperbolic secant)

The log chart does not change the content. It reveals that the content is **hyperbolic** — the natural geometry of the manifold in additive coordinates is hyperbolic, not trigonometric.

### 4.3 The Equator Is the Origin

In log coordinates, the equator (`φ = ν = 1, B = 1`) is `s = 0` — the origin of the additive line. Every direction is measured from it. Every distance is `|s|`. The ethic "move toward B = 1" becomes "move toward s = 0" — minimize your log-distance from finity.

### 4.4 The Two Poles Are Symmetric

On the additive line, 0 is the center and ∞ is unreachable. On the log line, 0 (`s = −∞`) and ∞ (`s = +∞`) are symmetric — equidistant from the center in opposite directions. This is the structural reason why the Titan emblem works: the two poles are not "zero and infinity" in an asymmetric sense; they are `−∞` and `+∞` on a line centered at finity.

### 4.5 The Old Model Is the Zero-Curvature Limit

The standard number line (0-centered, additive) is not wrong — it is the correct model for the operation of addition. But it is the **zero-curvature limit** of the richer structure. In the same way that a flat map is a projection of the curved Earth, the 0-centered line is a projection of the log-centered structure:

```
Standard line (0-centered, flat) = zero-curvature limit of log line (1-centered, curved)
```

The projection works locally (addition is fine near 0) but fails at the boundary (division by zero, 0 × ∞ indeterminate). The log line works everywhere because it centers on the point that is equidistant from both boundaries.

## 5. Provenance

The three-chart structure was independently derived by Minoru Suda (2025) in *Fractional Structure and Möbius Transformation Parts I–III*. The framework adopted Suda's formalisation in Trinity Canon §2a (2026-05-31) while maintaining priority on the underlying ideas (2024). The E–B bijection `B = sech(√E)` was proven as the bridge between Suda's apparatus and the framework's coordinates.

## 6. Discipline

1. **The log chart does not replace the sphere.** It is a coordinate chart on the sphere. The sphere S² remains the fundamental geometric object.
2. **The log chart does not replace the verbatim block.** The canonical formula block remains the verbatim block in multiplicative coordinates. The log form is a *re-expression*, not a *replacement*.
3. **The mathematics is all [A].** Nothing here is a new theorem. The contribution is the *reading* — that centering the number line at 1 in log coordinates makes the framework's entire structure elementary.
4. **The ontological claim remains [I].** That "1 is the center of the number line" is a mathematical truth in the multiplicative/logarithmic register `[A]`. That "this means finity is the center of Dasein" is an interpretive reading `[I]`.
