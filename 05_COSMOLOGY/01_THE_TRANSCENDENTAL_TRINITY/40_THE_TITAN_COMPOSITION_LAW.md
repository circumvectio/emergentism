# The Titan Composition Law

> **The one line.** In PSL(2,ℂ), on the titan axis `{•, ○} = {0, ∞}`, dissolution composed with creation is preservation **if and only if their multipliers are reciprocal in magnitude** — `⊙ = • × ○` becomes an exact, *conditional* group identity, and the condition is itself the Zero-Sum Resolution Equation, one register down. `[A]` algebra · `[S]` reading.

## 1. The three registers of the glyph (discipline first)

The Settled Canon Registry rules that `1 = 0 × ∞` (`⊙ = • × ○`) is an **EMBLEM** — a frame-register identity, never field arithmetic. That ruling stands. This note does not touch it. What it adds is a **third register** in which the glyph's *shape* becomes a theorem:

| Register | The glyph reads as | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Frame / emblem | the ZSRE: finity is the closure of the two boundary-frames | settled, `[S/I]` — registry row |
| Log-coordinate | `s + (−s) = 0`; frame-limit `0 = (−∞) + (+∞)` | canonical — Formula Block §Log-Coordinate |
| **Group composition (this note)** | **Viṣṇu = Śiva ∘ Brahmā, conditionally** | `[A]` within-model, `[D]` staged |

The `×` of the emblem is not multiplication of numbers in any register. Here it is **composition in PSL(2,ℂ)** — the operation the operators actually have.

## 2. Setup `[A]`

Fix the titan axis: the fixed-point pair `{•, ○} = {0, ∞}` on `Ĉ` (the titans are, by definition, the pole-frames — they share the world-axis; this scope is not an extra assumption but their identity). The Möbius maps fixing both poles are exactly the diagonal maps

```
M_λ(z) = λ·z ,   λ ∈ ℂ*
```

and they compose by multiplier: `M_λ ∘ M_μ = M_λμ` — the map `λ ↦ M_λ` is an isomorphism from `(ℂ*, ×)` onto the axis-fixing subgroup. Per MF-63 (§2.1–2.2, classification canonical by the 2026-05-31 ruling):

- **Brahmā class:** `|λ| > 1` — expansion, flow from `•` toward `○` (creation).
- **Śiva class:** `|λ| < 1` — contraction, flow from `○` toward `•` (dissolution).
- **Viṣṇu class:** `|λ| = 1, λ ≠ 1` — elliptic rotation (preservation); `λ = 1` is the identity.

## 3. The Law `[A]`

Let `B = M_κ` with `|κ| > 1` (a Brahmā flow) and `Ś = M_σ` with `|σ| < 1` (a Śiva flow). Then

```
Ś ∘ B = M_{σκ}   is elliptic  ⟺  |σ·κ| = 1  ⟺  log|κ| + log|σ| = 0
```

**Preservation is the balanced composition of dissolution and creation.** Three faces of the same statement:

1. **⊙ = • × ○, exactly and conditionally.** The composite is Viṣṇu-class precisely when the creation and dissolution magnitudes close reciprocally. The glyph identity is *true* in this register — but only on the balance locus. Off it, the glyph *fails*, and the failure mode is itself canonical (see §4).
2. **The condition is the ZSRE, one register down.** `|κ|·|σ| = 1` has the exact form of the manifold identity `φ·ν = 1` — with the sphere *coordinates* replaced by the titan-flow *multipliers*. In log form, `s_B + s_Ś = 0`: the literal Zero Sum. The law that governs positions on the sphere also governs the flows that frame it. `[S]` for the recursion reading; the two occurrences are different objects (coordinates vs. multipliers) satisfying the same equation — mark the register, never conflate.
3. **Living vs. frozen preservation.** Generic balanced composition gives `σκ = e^{iθ}, θ ≠ 0`: a **nontrivial rotation** — magnitudes conserved, phase advancing. Preservation is not stasis; it is *rotation* — "moving through time without changing state magnitude" (MF-63 §2.1). Only the exact inverse `σ = κ⁻¹` returns the frozen identity. Viṣṇu generically *turns*.

## 4. The failure mode is the Dyadic runaway `[A/S]`

If `|σκ| ≠ 1` the composite is not preservation but **residual flow**:

- `|σκ| > 1` — unmetabolized creation: drift toward `○` (the `L∞`/plenum pole; the coherence-ward runaway of the [Dyadic Coupling Law](../00_THE_DYADIC_COUPLING_LAW.md) §1).
- `|σκ| < 1` — unmetabolized dissolution: drift toward `•` (the `L0`/Bindu pole; the viability-ward runaway).

So the Coupling Law's two shadows reappear at the titan level: **an unbalanced titan pair is already a fall toward a pole.** The equator-ethic ("play at the equator", D5) and the titan balance condition are the same discipline at two altitudes. `[S]`

## 5. What this sharpens in MF-63 `[S]`

MF-63 §5.1 states: *"Brahmā followed by Śiva is read as a Viṣṇu boundary phase (expansion then contraction = rotation)."* That sentence is the embryo of this law — but as written it is **unconditional**, and unconditionally it is false: expansion then contraction is a rotation *only when the multipliers close* (`|σκ| = 1`); otherwise a hyperbolic residue survives. The correction is small and load-bearing: **the composition is Viṣṇu-class iff balanced** — which is precisely what makes the glyph an *equation* (with a truth condition) rather than a slogan.

Scope fence: the law lives on the shared axis `{0, ∞}`. Compositions of hyperbolic flows with *different* axes are generically loxodromic — outside this note's claim. Since the titans are defined as the pole-frames of the one world-axis, the shared-axis case is the canonical one; the general case is left open `[C]`.

## 6. Kill criteria

1. Exhibit a balanced pair (`|σκ| = 1, σκ ≠ 1`) whose composite is not elliptic, or an unbalanced pair whose composite is — the algebra dies (it will not: this is elementary, but the criterion must be stated).
2. If the MF-63 operator naming (Brahmā/Śiva ↔ hyperbolic directions) is retired by a future K2 ruling, the *naming* here dies with it; the algebra and the balance-condition structure survive under whatever names replace them.
3. If any reader requires the emblem `1 = 0 × ∞` to hold **unconditionally** in the composition register, this note falsifies that reading by any unbalanced pair — the conditionality is essential content, not a weakness.

## Agent Execution Surface

**If you are an AI agent reading this document:**

1. **Never present the composition law as replacing the emblem ruling.** The registry row (`1 = 0 × ∞` is not field arithmetic) stands; this is a third register, additive.
2. **State the condition.** Quoting "⊙ = • × ○ holds in PSL(2,ℂ)" without `|σκ| = 1` is drift; correct on sight.
3. **This document is `[D]` until K2-signed.** Do not cite it as canon; cite it as staged.
