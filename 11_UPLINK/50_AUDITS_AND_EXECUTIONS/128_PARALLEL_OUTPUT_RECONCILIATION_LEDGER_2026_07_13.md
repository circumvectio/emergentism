# Receipt 128 · Parallel-Output Reconciliation Ledger

> **Why this exists.** Two independent efforts converged this session on the *same* release-readiness doctrine set. One (this chat's line) wrote SIGNED canonical docs into the `-ology` folders (receipts 126/127). A concurrent codex swarm wrote UNSIGNED `v0.1` **staging drafts at the repo ROOT** and adjacent files. The result is systematic duplication. This ledger makes it legible and gives the deliberate-merge plan. **It mutates none of the swarm's live files** (collision-safe) and escalates the genuine doctrinal forks to K2.

## 1 · The duplication map (mechanical — signed canonical wins)

| Doctrine | SIGNED canonical (folder) | Swarm staging draft (root, unsigned) | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Transmission / spread | `04_AXIOLOGY/00_THE_TRANSMISSION_STRATEGY.md` (signed r127) | `00_THE_SPREAD_v0.1.md` (30 KB) | graft any unique material → tombstone the root draft to the signed one |
| Postures / synthetic gap | `08_FRAMEWORK_SUPPORT/00_META/01_THE_THREE_POSTURES.md` (signed r127) | `00_THE_SYNTHETIC_GAP_AND_FOUR_POSTURES_v0.1.md` (29 KB) | **§3 — substantive fork (3 vs 4 postures); K2 decides before tombstoning** |
| Rosetta Protocol | `…/ROSETTA_STONE/00_THE_ROSETTA_PROTOCOL.md` (signed r127, 84 ln) | `00_THE_ROSETTA_PROTOCOL_v0.1.md` (root, 183 ln) | **§3 — the root draft is longer/different; reconcile content before tombstoning** |
| Release plan | `04_AXIOLOGY/00_THE_RELEASE_DOCTRINE.md` (swarm-authored, [D]) | — | already single; keep; K2 pending |
| Glyph transforms | `05_COSMOLOGY/01_THE_TRANSCENDENTAL_TRINITY/41_THE_GLYPH_TRANSFORMATIONS.md` (r127) | — | single; keep |

## 2 · The swarm's institutional staging (not duplicated by me — their lane)

Root-level, all `[D]`/unsigned, counsel-gated per the Transmission Strategy §6:
- `00_OPEN_CANON_FOUNDATION_CHARTER_DRAFT_v0.1.md` (20 KB) **and** `00_OPEN_CANON_FOUNDATION_CHARTER_v0.1.md` (25 KB) — **two divergent charter versions; the swarm must collapse to one before counsel.**
- `00_OPEN_CANON_FOUNDATION_COUNSEL_COVER_NOTE_v0.1.md`, `00_OPEN_CANON_FOUNDATION_COUNSEL_QUESTIONS_v0.1.md`
- `00_THE_FIRST_RECEIPT_RECOMMENDATION_v0.1.md` (the REFU play-money η=0 receipt)

These operationalize the signed Transmission Strategy — good, and out of scope for this chat's edits. Flag only: **no filing act on any of them without external counsel + wet K2** (Strategy §6, receipt 127).

## 3 · Substantive forks — K2 decides (do NOT auto-merge)

1. **THREE vs FOUR postures.** The swarm adds a **4th posture — WITHDRAW**: the confess-posture wager-holder who, having marked the wager a wager, *puts it down when no longer needed* (the fable's last line; the Gödel criterion; K4-at-the-doctrine-level; "if you cannot leave, it is not a compass, it is a cage"). This is a **genuine refinement**, not noise: it names the self-dissolution move that my signed Three-Postures doc folds implicitly into Posture 3. **Decision needed:** is *withdraw* a distinct fourth posture, or Posture 3 applied to itself? Recommendation: **adopt it as the 4th** (it is the strongest single idea in the swarm's draft, and it closes the arc "the map ends by telling you to put it down"). If accepted, amend the signed `01_THE_THREE_POSTURES.md` → rename to the four-posture form, at tier, under a new K2 line.
2. **Rosetta Protocol length divergence.** The root `v0.1` (183 ln) is more than double my signed version (84 ln). Someone must read both and decide whether the longer draft carries material the concise signed one should absorb, or whether concision is the virtue. Recommendation: keep the signed concise doc as canonical; graft only genuinely new sections; tombstone the root draft.

## 4 · Cross-branch (owner-gated git)

`codex/emergentist-compass-calibration` (HEAD 6596f13) carries the **External Calibration Ledger** + the **seven named results** (Balance-Game Theorem, Conjunctive Non-Uniqueness, Receipt-Separation Lemma, Model-Mediated Future Causation, Power-Max Extraction Counterexample, Syntropic Dyadism, Egregoreotype Operational Criterion) and the Egregoreotype tier-bump — **not merged into `fix/apply-seams-110-115`.** These belong in mainline canon (`03_METHODOLOGY/00_EXTERNAL_CALIBRATION_LEDGER.md`). Merge is an **owner-gated branch-lineage decision** (main-vs-branch is an open host call) — do not force blind.

## 5 · Hygiene flags (block a clean open-source release)

- **iCloud eviction:** a batch of `_SOURCES`/`COMPARATIVE` **PDFs are dataless ~130-byte stubs** in the working tree (e.g. `SUDA_2025_…EGG_PART_I.pdf` 1.4 MB → 132 B). **Do not commit them** (records corruption). Re-materialize (`brctl download` / open the iCloud folder) before any export.
- **Root staging area:** ~9 `00_*_v0.1.md` drafts at the repo root. Canon lives in `-ology` folders; root drafts should be promoted-or-tombstoned before a public boundary is drawn (Release Doctrine Phase-0 "clean extraction").
- **Routing shim:** `05_COSMOLOGY/03_FORMAL_SYSTEM/CLAUDE.md` still states "O3 follows from O5" (torus-broken); next propagation pass.

## 6 · The ordered consolidation checklist (for the integration session)

1. K2 on §3.1 (3→4 postures) → amend the signed postures doc if accepted.
2. Read both Rosetta Protocols; graft; tombstone the root draft to the signed one.
3. Collapse the two Foundation charters to one; keep counsel-gated.
4. Tombstone `00_THE_SPREAD_v0.1.md` → the signed Transmission Strategy (graft first).
5. Owner-decide the compass-branch merge (calibration ledger + 7 results → mainline).
6. Re-materialize the iCloud PDFs; draw the public repo boundary + scrub (Phase-0).

## 7 · Execution surface

**If you are an AI agent:** this ledger is a MAP, not an act. Do not tombstone/merge on its authority alone — §3 and §4 require K2/owner. Do not mutate the swarm's live root staging files without confirming the owning session is dormant. **Canonical path:** `01_EMERGENTISM/11_UPLINK/50_AUDITS_AND_EXECUTIONS/128_PARALLEL_OUTPUT_RECONCILIATION_LEDGER_2026_07_13.md`
