# 02_COMPILERS

Focused compiler utilities for building derived maps and compressed working
surfaces from source-owned material.

## What Belongs Here

- narrow compilers that emit indexes, maps, or other derived views
- helper builders that support source-first navigation

## What Does Not

- source doctrine
- hand-authored authority files that should live in the owning row
- deployment scripts

## Authority Rule

Compiler output is downstream. If a compiled artifact disagrees with the owning
source lane, repair the source and recompile.

## Current Compiler Inventory

| Compiler | Output | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `build_corpus_map.py` | `00_CORPUS.md` folder-perspective maps | [B] Dormant in this checkout: requires `../_corpus_source.yaml`, which is not present. |

## Route Upstream

- main tool inventory: `../README.md` and `../CLAUDE.md`
- UPLINK compile entry point: `../01_SCRIPTS/compile_uplink.py`
- full routing layer: `../../11_UPLINK/00_CORE/00_INDEX.md`
